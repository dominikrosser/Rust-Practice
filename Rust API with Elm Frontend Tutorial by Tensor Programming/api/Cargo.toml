## + (PostgreSQL, diesel_cli)
## You need to have postgres sql installed and then run this command:
## cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
## Also make sure postgres sql is in your path environment variables...
## There's an executable in your PG install directory which does this for you.
## Consider the following:
## What version of PostgresSQL do you have installed?
## It sounds like diesel isn't finding the libraries that it needs,
## which is a problem that I also ran into with the BigSQL PgSQL distribution.
## The way I fixed this myself was to install the Enterprise DB version of PgSQL.
## Then you need to setup a PQ_LIB_DIR enviroment variable that
## points at the PostgreSQL/lib directory which is where pqlib.dll and pqlib.lib is located.
## Here is the link to download EnterpriseDB
## https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
## and here are instructions for pg-sys which diesel_CLI relies on:
## https://github.com/sgrif/pq-sys
## Also make sure that you are only installing it for the database that you are going to use
## and have installed on your computer.
## Could be MySql or SQLite as well but I don't know much about the installation
## of diesel with those two.
## After you've installed enterpriseDB make sure to reinstall diesel_CLI with the cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres --force command.ï»¿
## The other is to just put your PQ_LIB_DIR environment variable directly on your path
## and once you do that make sure to reinstall diesel.
## Also, make sure the C:\PostgreSQL\bin folder is on your path as well.
## Some of the libs in there are also required but I think the documentation assumes that
## you've already put that on your path.  And of course you need to make sure that the PGSQL
## server is running when you run diesel.
